This project was developed as part of COMP 202 (Foundations of Programming) at McGill University. 

# Python OOP Project â€” COMP 202
This project applies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to solve problems using **Python classes, methods, and file I/O**.

## Highlights
- Implemented custom classes with constructors, attributes, and methods.
- Worked with **lists, dictionaries, and strings** to process and store structured data.
- Added **file input/output** to read/write persistent data.
- Designed error handling using **exceptions** for robust program behavior.
- Documented all functions with **docstrings** including type contracts and examples.

## Tech
- **Python 3**
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Lists, dictionaries, strings
- File I/O, exceptions

## Notes
- This repo contains only my authored Python files (assignment starter code and instructions excluded per course policy).
